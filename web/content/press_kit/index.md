## Description
In `ai://artificial_insentience`, you use cutting-edge AI techniques to train your own AI, which you then pit against other peoples'.

This isn't a game about training AI, this is doing it for real.

In a clash of strategy and management gameplay, build your AI's ship, design the training programme, run the training, and then battle over the internet. Win battles and you will unlock new ship parts and training techniques. Create the strongest AI in the world.
