`ai://artificial_insentience` is a game about training your AI to fight other people's AIs.

This isn't a simulation. You will use the same cutting edge AI techniques used by [OpenAI Five](https://openai.com/blog/openai-five/) and [DeepMind's AlphaStar](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii) to train a neural network that battles networks trained by other people. 

The game's core features are almost finished, so it'll be entering closed beta soon. For now, enjoy some screenshots.
